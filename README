Hleahtor is a very basic application that pops a notification bubble for you 
everytime it finds an update to your favourite comic strips.

As of now, it checks for updates once every 24 hours.

To run hleahtor, simple type in a terminal:

$ hleahtor &

There isn't an exit mechanism yet, please "kill" it to exit.

Hleahtor copies system configuration files to the ~/.hleahtor directory. You can edit these
as per your requirements. There are two config files, one for application configuration
and the other for comics. 

You will need to restart hleahtor in order for the changes in configuration files to be loaded.
