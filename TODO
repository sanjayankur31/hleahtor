- clean up isMoreRecent (there must be a shorter, better way to compare dates)
- add error pop ups
- clean up src/Makefile.am to use proper stuff for the libnotify flags and libs
- break down functions into smaller bits?
- use a better daemon implementation than sleep()
- add an exit mechanism
- signal handling
- configurable update period

- anything else??
